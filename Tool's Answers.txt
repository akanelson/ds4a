We would like that the tool in which we will be working on could answer some questions:
====================
About drivers (many)
====================
- How many drivers work in the agency zone?
  filter: drivers that were active last [n] days
  filter: with more than [n] itinararies finished
  . Historical
  . Last month
  . Last 30 days
  . Last week
  . Last 7 days
  . Yesterday
  . Today
  . Range

- Top drivers per number of itineraries
- Top drivers per number of packages (finished)
- Top drivers per accumulated distance
- Top drivers per avg time
- Top drivers per <create metric> i.e. packages [finished] per time
- Top drivers per <create metric>
- Top drivers per <create metric>

- Show drivers locations timeline per datetime (yyyy-mm-dd HH)
  . This is a map with a time slider and some filters to restrict de type of drivers

[TODO: think more]

================
About driver (1)
================
- Metrics mentioned above (in about drivers)
- Show driver historical locations timeline
- Show driver historical all locations at the same time
  . May be we could create some kind of region per driver that will help to create a cluster with other drivers
  . May be we could use the historical driver location to predict future locations per driver

[TODO: think more]

========================
About itineraries (many)
========================
- How many itineraries have [finished] in last [period]?
- How many itineraries have [finished] per hour in last [day]?

- Top itineraries per total time
- Top itineraries per number of packages
- Top intineraries per distance

- [TODO: think more]

===================
About itinerary (1)
===================
- Show all info that we know about itinerary
. All itinerari's location/s on a map, driver/s, status, all that we know, etc.

- [TODO]

=======================
Predict Future Capacity 
=======================
How many packages per day we could send on next week?
. Today is: [date]
. Data known will be limited to 'Today' input and will predict number of packages per day next week from [today]

How many packages per hour we could send on next 24 hours?
. Today is: [datetime]
. Data known will be limited to 'Today' input and will predict number of packages per hour
